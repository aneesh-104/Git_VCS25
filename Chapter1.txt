The first chapter containing basis of Git VCS                  
1.Use 'master' as name for initial branch. Names used in place of 'master' are trunk, development,main
 # Working directory (Untracked Area)  -->   Staging Area --> Git Repository
2. To move file from Working Directory to Staging Area use command "git add filename". Use command "git status" to check whether file transferred to Staging Area.
3. Further git commit -m 'Chapter1'  where '-m'  is message flag else git commit is also sufficient command. git commit to move file from Staging Area to Git Repository
 ** Cmd 'git log' shows commit history ; git log --oneline   { shows short one line logs rather than detail including date, author,hash code]
4. To configure username & email commands => git config --global user.name "Aneesh P"  & git config --global user.email "aneeshp@cybage.com"
5. git checkout file_name => to rollback to last commited version of file. Ex- If I wrote data in file and commited it after that if i made changes and save in text editor then the staging area version of file will get modified. In such case if I want previous version of file use checkout commandd to return back to latest commited version
6. Use git restore --staged file_name  => To unstage file
7.{Remote Repository]
git remote add origin url_of_remote_repository.
